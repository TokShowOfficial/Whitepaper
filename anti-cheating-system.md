# Anti-Cheating System

1. **Prevent fake live broadcasts and live broadcasts without content.**

* Monitor the live broadcast content to ensure that it is a real and effective live broadcast.
* Users who give gifts to the host in the same live broadcast room must be scattered to a certain extent. If they are too concentrated, they will be considered as suspected of cheating.
* If cheating or disqualification is found, the host will receive a reminder to postpone the withdrawal and prohibit the live broadcast until one month has passed.
* More monitoring algorithms are being updated at any time.

2. **Prevent users from swiping their own trumpet.**

* 24 hours a day monitoring.
* Manual irregular inspections.
* More monitoring algorithms are being updated at any time.
