# Deflationary economic model

1. Exchange Diamond's TKST Token: 90% goes to the treasury, 10% is burned.
2. Dynamically adjust the daily limited quantity of TKST currency exchanged for diamonds according to the currency price.
3. The specific amount will be announced after the mainnet goes online.

**Currency price smoothing mechanism for treasury cash:**

* The treasury sets the currency price target area, and when it is higher than the area, set the grid to sell a certain amount of TKST Token.
* When the currency price is lower than the minimum limit, set up a grid transaction to purchase TKST Token and recycle TKST Token.
* Treasury uses up to 10% of TKST for price smoothing transactions, and the specific trading strategy is determined by community voting.
