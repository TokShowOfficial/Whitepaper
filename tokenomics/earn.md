# Earn

**Users who are not lower than level 5 can earn, and can mine earn TKST token permanently.**

* The higher the level, the more earn.
* The higher the energy points, the more earn.
* Mining adopts a decreasing output model, and the output is halved every 6 months.
* As long as the earn token is mined every day, regardless of the change of the currency price, in principle, it will pay back within 6 months.

The formula for earning token by mining every day is**:**

&#x20;                           **Tokens mined every day= ( T/ROI ) / P \* H**

**T：**The target output amount，corresponding to the user level.

&#x20;      After the user upgrades to a new level, the target output amount is recalculated.

&#x20;      T = Current level corresponding amount - Historical cumulative output amount

**ROI**: Time (ROI)-Payback cycle

&#x20;       Basic Time (ROI) = 180.     Time (ROI) can be as short as 30 days.

&#x20;       Users can shorten the time (ROI) by inviting users, see Referral System for details.

**P**：The 24-hour TKST average price of the previous day.

**H**：Under the user's current level,The number of days between the upgrade day and today.

&#x20;      Difference<= 180 days, H=1

&#x20;      Difference> 180 days, H=0.5
